# Standup Steve

Let's face it, we have all been there, do you ever feel, etc. These are all great ways to start an informercial...which is what I'm going to do RIGHT NOW!

HI, I'M CHASTEP "COMMERCIAL" GUY HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU ABOUT AN AMAZING NEW PRODUCT BEING BUILT CALLED STANDUP STEVE!!! 

Let's face it, writing out standup in slack everyday when you aren't present is tedious and time consuming. We could all spend our time in a more constructive and productive way (i.e. actually doing **HARDCORE** development work and "putting the development team on our backs" so to speak). We have all been there, feeling the morning drudge of typing WORDS that form SENTENCES into slack with some sweet `:slack:` and `:standup:` emojis attached to indicate we are in pajamas working from home. NO MORE I SAY. NO MORE MINDLESS MORNING UPDATES TO INDICATE OUR DAILY WORK.

What if I told you there is an amazing new product on its way that will help the entire team (1) automate this daily task, (2) compile and report all user standups, and (3) change the way you perform your professional duties as you know it? What can this amazing product do for YOU? Well, let me welcome to the stage STANDUP STEVE who will tell you about its amazing basic feature set! *(cue roar from audience and studio recorded clapping)*

**HIYA FOLKS, IM STANDUP STEVE. LET ME TELL YAH A BIT ABOUT MYSELF**
